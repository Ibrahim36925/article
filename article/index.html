        <p class="p-2">What is a React?</p>
         <p class="p-3">React is a Javascript library for building frontend web application or UI.
            React<br>allows us to create reusable UI components. It is developed by Facebook.</p>
        <p class="p-4">Features of React</p>

            <li>Reusable Components</li>
            <li>Open Source</li>

         <p class="p-5">SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION (SPA)<br> VS. MULTI-PAGE APPLICATION<br> (MPA)</p>
         <img class="two" src="https://www.tekrevol.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Singal-Page-Application-Vs-Multi-Page-Application-.png" alt="">
         <p class="p-6">Differences Between SPA And MPA</p>
         <p class="p-7">The difference between SPA and MPA is that MPAs secures each page to its core.<br> Therefore, it takes more time and effort to maintain the security; hence, page loading<br> time is more.<br><br>

            SPAs secure endpoints faster, but the security level is low. SPAs generally rely on<br> JavaScript. This makes them vulnerable to being attacked by cybercriminals because<br> of the data not being compiled for security.<br><br>
            
            SPAs are considered more “modern” and attuned to today’s agile development needs.<br><br>
            
            However, this doesn’t mean that MPAs don’t work out. Have you ever used Amazon?<br> The world’s largest eCommerce website? Amazon is an MPA and this effectively<br> means that whenever you request new content, the page has to reload all over again.<br> This is considered conventional architecture, but it’s still highly valuable and is used<br> with great results.<br><br>
            
            MPAs are best suited for complex websites that do not require a continuation of<br> approach. For e.g. on Amazon, you don’t require your page to stay the same when you<br> want to view a product or category. So if you are thinking of building, let’s say a very<br> large eCommerce site, then you should opt for an MPA architecture.
            
            But wait! That’s<br> not the only thing you should take into account before making the final decision. There<br> are others as well.</p>
            <p class="p-8">Angular vs React:</p>
            <img class="three" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--9W-fM57M--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/n4iz8kup3wwswkoo8mhf.png" alt="">
            <p class="p-9">Angular vs React, While making a web application, picking which JavaScript system<br> to utilize can be an awesome choice. The Google and Facebook front end movement<br> structures have enormous planner frameworks, at any rate, unique excitement for the<br> business vs application idea. There are different choices, yet unequivocal contest<br> incorporates the decision between two of the heaviest hitters: Angular or React?<br><br>

                Angular vs React<br><br>
                
                Angular is a full stack web application system situated in Typescript, regularly<br> connected with the front end design pattern toward Single Page Applications, and<br> kept up by Google. Angular is a superheroic JavaScript MVVM system, developed in<br> 2009, which is incredible for structure exceedingly web applications. React is a UI<br> library situated in JavaScript, ordinarily connected with the pattern toward part based<br> engineering, and is kept up by Facebook.</p>
                <p class="p-10">Framework vs Library</p>
                <img class="four" src="https://kruschecompany.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Cover-image-for-blog-post-defining-the-difference-1280x595.png" alt="">
                <p class="p-11">The goal of frameworks and libraries is the same: to expand the range of out-of-the-box<br> functions available to developers, optimising their workload and reducing room for<br> error and inefficient code.  Frameworks and libraries are blocks of code developed by<br> third parties that help solve common problems in a particular programming language.<br><br>

                    However, there are technical differences between them. One core difference between a<br> framework and a library is the use of queries. When using a library, the programmer<br> decides when and where to call it.<br><br>
                    
                    When using a framework, the framework dictates that. It provides the basic framework<br> and tells the programmer what is needed. Accordingly, the necessary code is inserted<br> by the developer and supplements the framework according to the desired function.<br> In the end, however, it is the framework that calls up the code when it needs it and is<br> also responsible for the running of the programme.<br><br>
                    
                    The following diagram illustrates that core technical difference between how a<br> framework and library work:</p>

                    <p class="p-12">Dom vs virtual Dom?</p>
                    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--fQJdJ8uD--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/sigd93l2jlmo4pvuy49z.jpg" alt="" class="six">
                    <p class="p-13">DOM is a language-neutral interface allowing programs and scripts to dynamically<br> access and update multiple objects like content, structure, and style of a document.<br>Virtual dom is a collection of modules designed to provide a declarative way to<br> represent the DOM for an application.<br><br>The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects.A virtual DOM object is a<br> representation of a DOM object, like a lightweight copy.<br><br>It is an object-oriented representation of a web page, modified with a scripting<br> language like JavaScript.Virtual DOM is ideal for mobile-first applications.</p>
                    <p class="p-14">Oneway Data Binding vs Two way</p>
                    <p class="p-15">Oneway Data Binding</p>
                    <p class="p-16">One-way data-binding means the data flows in a single direction so that whenever the<br> data changes in a component, it also updates the view with new data.<br><br>Example:</p>
                    <img src="https://reactgo.com/static/4d20f719815a77c761891f93492e98c7/33e10/angular-one-way-data-binding.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb3" alt="" class="six">
                    <p class="p-17">Have you seen in the above image the data property we defined inside the<br> app.component.ts file is connected to the html template by using {{}} syntax.<br><br>Now if we change the title property inside app.component.ts file our view also<br> updates with the new change this is called one-way data binding.</p>
                    <p class="p-18">Twoway Data Binding</p>
                    <p class="p-19">Two-way data binding means data flows in both directions, it means any change<br> happens in the view updates the data and any change happens in the data updates the<br> view.<br><br>In angular, by using ngModel directive we can create two-way data binding.<br><br>Example:<br><br></p>
                    <img src="https://reactgo.com/static/e8f8dd1b4e6da11b98cb75cf16304d85/5caea/angular-two-way-databinding.png?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb3" alt="" class="seven">
                    <p class="p-20">In the above image, we have connected the data property title to the input element by<br> using Model directive.<br><br>Now, if we change the (input) element value in the view it updates the title property.<br>similarly, if we change the title property inside the component file it also the updates the<br> (input) element value.</p>
